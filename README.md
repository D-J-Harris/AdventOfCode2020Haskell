# AdventOfCode2020Haskell
Solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2020 "AOC 2020"), attempted in Haskell (a new language for me)

Setup and solution tutorials followed [here](https://github.com/haskelling/aoc2020 "Haskelling") (hopefully with less supervision as the days go on!)
